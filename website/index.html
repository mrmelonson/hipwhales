   <h2 class="quote_box">All the worlds a stage, <br>
   And all the men and women merely players; <br> 
   They have their exits and their entrances; <br>
   And one man in his time plays many parts,  <br>
   His acts being seven ages.” </h2>

   <h3>- William Shakespeare</h3>

   <h1 class="breaker">----------------</h1>

   <p>The taming of the shrew remains current for the 21st century as is explores a dark side of human nature, that is the inevitability of those in power to take advantage, manipulate and control those beneath them. </p>
   <p>We see this within the taming of the shrew and those in power such as Batista and Petruchio who don’t think about the people below them, but rather how they can manipulate the situation in their favour.</p>
   <p>The play also explores themes of transformation through Petruchio manipulateing, controling and transforming Kate into an obediant and submissive wife.</p>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p>I believe that taming of the shrew remains as a current play in the 21st century as it reflects vital parts even today of the human condition.</p>
