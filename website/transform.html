    <h1>Transformation</h1>

    <center><img class="img" src="taming_2268837b.jpg" alt="Paris" width="50%" height="50%"></center>

    <p>Transformation is prevalent throughout the play and is a main theme of such. 
        The most obvious example is Kate with Petruchio, where he transforms Kate from a shrew to a obedient and submissive wife through falconry techniques. 
        One of the clearest signs of transformation is the way Kate speaks before and after the transformation for example:</p>

    <h2 class="quote_box">I will be angry: what hast thou to do?â€” <br>
            Father, be quiet. He shall stay my leisure. </h2>

    <center><img class="img" src="oooo.jpg" width="50%", width="50%"></center>
    
    <h3>- 3.2.221-223</h3>

    <p>In this quote Kate is being told to calm down and when her father tries to talk she quickly shuts him up. 
        Compare this type of behaviour to that of the end of the play:</p>

    <h2 class="quote_box">Such duty as the subject owes the prince <br>
            Even such a woman oweth to her husband; <br>
            And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour, <br>
            And not obedient to his honest will, <br>
            What is she but a foul contending rebel</h2>

    <h3>- 5.2.171-175</h3>
   
    <p>In this quote Kate is saying that the home is like a mini-kingdom and a rebellious wife could threaten the kingdom which is much, much different to the Kate that was at the start of the play.</p>

    <h1>Connection to human condition</h1>

    <p>There are a few take aways from this, one of which is that even though she had been abused and was transformed, Kate is still kate, she still wants to be rebellious and dominant but petrutio has her under his power much like the society we live in where rebellious people quickly get transformed into obedient, submissive citizens</p>
