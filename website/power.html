   <h1>Power and control</h1>

   <p>Power and control is very prevalent throughout the play and is a large theme throughout the play. 
    A key example is where Petruchio is overpowering and controlling Kate and this quote outlines how Petruchio thinks about it:</p>

    <h2 class="quote_box">It shall be seven ere I go to horse. <br>
            Look, what I speak, or do, or think to do, <br>
            You are still crossing it.â€”Sirs, let 't alone. <br>
            I will not go today, and, ere I do, <br>
            It shall be what o'clock I say it is.<br>
            HORTENSIO, aside <br>
            Why, so, this gallant will command the sun!</h3>

    <h3>- 4.3.198-203</h3>

    <p>Here Petruchio says that he Is so powerful that he could control the sun and views his role in the marriage as a god-like figure.</p>

    <h1>Connection to human condition</h1>
    
    <p>This relates to the human condition and human nature and is reflected in our own society with people in higher social positions manipulating and controlling the people lower than them to control the outcomes of certain events in their favour. </p>
